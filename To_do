To - Do Items:

* Right now there is a significant bug caused by inconsistent columns in SEC tables.
	These inconsistencies are generally found in older filings (pre 2014).
	This leads to completely senseless and jumbled data.
* In addition, I'm not sure if the 0.70 fuzzy ratio is working as intended in 
	old financials

(both of these are reproducible via LWAY financials)
