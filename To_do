To - Do Items:

* Add in units detection for values - i.e. in Thousands $ USD
* consider taking out self.cik = cik from initalization -- currently unused but could be good for a refactor.
 right now I don't see a point in keeping the DataScraper class as anything more than a library of functions
* on second thought probably keep self.cik, delete last fn, then work on DataProcessor class.
